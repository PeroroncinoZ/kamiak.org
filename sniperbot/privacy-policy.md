## Privacy Policy

### Usage of Data
The Bot may use stored data, as defined below, for different features including but not limited to: A "super secret" future [kakera](https://mudae.fandom.com/wiki/Kakera) system.  
No usage of data outside of the aformentioned cases will happen and the data is not shared with any 3rd-party site or service.

### Stored Information
The Bot may store the following information automatically when someone is "doxxed":

- `doxxes` in the form of a counter representing how many times someone has been "doxxed"

No other information outside of the above mentioned one will be stored.

### Updating Data
The data may be updated when using the command `pls dox`, synonymous with `plz dox`.
Updating data will require the input of an end user.

No actions other than removal may update the stored information at any given time.

### Temporarily stored Information
The Bot may store deleted sent messages (which may be seen as sensitive data) temporarily until a timer completes, or the command `pls snipe` is sent within a Discord Channel. The Bot will drop the cached message regardless of whether said command was executed. Upon execution of said command, the Bot will send the cached message's contents within said Discord Channel.

A Discord user may request their deleted sent messages to be exempted from caching altogether by contacting the email `joseph1000000007@gmail.com` or the Discord user `joseph#9050`.

### Removal of Data
Stored Data is completely anonymous and cannot be removed. The Bot does not yet store Personal Data, and no Stored Data is attached to any Discord user.

<!---

#### Automatic removal
Stored Data can be removed automatically through means of removing the bot from a Server. This can be achieved by either kicking or banning the bot from the server. Re-inviting the bot will add the same default values, as mentioned above, back to the bot's database.

#### Manual removal
Manual removal of the data can be requested through email at support@purrbot.site.  
For security reasons will we ask you to provide us with proof of ownership of the server, that you wish the data to be removed of. Only a server owner may request manual removal of data and requesting it will result in the bot being removed from the server, if still present on it.

!!! info "Technical limitations"
    The automatic removal of data has certain limitations that we cannot fix or avoid.  
    Limitations include, but aren't limited to, downtime of the bot due to maintenance or technical issues at our hosting provider or Discord Inc.
    In such events can you request [manual removal](#manual-removal) through email under the above mentioned conditions.
