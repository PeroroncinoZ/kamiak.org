# Tips for Effectively Managing Homework - The Levi Principle
1. Do your homework the moment you get the chance to, and this includes during school. Doing so helps make use of time that you would otherwise waste. It also provides a better work environment as it is more difficult to get sidetracked.
2. Complete your homework as quickly as possible: This can easily halve the time it takes. It also helps from getting sidetracked.
3. Either put your all towards homework, or enjoy your free time. Not fully committing to either will only waste your time.
4. If you are working on a project, it is okay to bend these rules to a *small* extent for the purpose of sleep and the like.
