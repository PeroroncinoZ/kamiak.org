# Tips for Effectively Managing Homework - The Levi Principle
1. Do your homework the moment you get the chance to. This includes during school.
2. Complete your homework as quickly as possible. This can easily halve the time it takes. It also helps from getting sidetracked.
3. If you are working on a project, it is okay to bend these rules to a **SMALL** extent.
