# Tips for Effectively Managing Homework - The Levi Principle
1. Do your homework the moment you get the chance to; this includes during school. Doing so helps make use of time that you would otherwise waste. It also provides a better work environment as it is more difficult to get sidetracked.
2. Complete your homework as quickly as possible: This can easily halve the time it takes. It also helps from getting sidetracked.
3. If you are working on a project, it is okay to bend these rules to a **SMALL** extent.
