# Tips for Effectively Managing Homework - The Levi Principle
1. Do your homework ***the moment*** you get the chance to, and ***this includes during school.*** Doing so helps make use of time *that you would otherwise waste.* It also provides a better work environment as it is more difficult to get sidetracked.
2. **Fully commit:** Put ***your all*** in towards your homework and complete it ***as quickly and efficiently as possible***: This can easily **halve** the time it takes and also helps from getting sidetracked. Not fully committing to homework or leisure will only waste your time.
4. These rules can be applied to other areas and should **only** be disregarded in the pursuit of sleep, women, and the like.
