# Tips for Effectively Managing Homework - The Levi Principle
1. **Do your homework as soon as possible,** and this includes during school. Doing so helps make use of time that you would otherwise *waste*. It also provides a *better work environment* as it is more difficult to get sidetracked.
2. **Fully commit:** Put your all towards homework to complete it *as quickly and efficiently as possible*. This can easily *halve* the time it takes, and it also helps prevent sidetracking. Not fully committing to homework or leisure is a waste of your time.
3. **You can apply these rules to other areas,** but you may disregard them *only* in the pursuit of sleep, women, and the like.
