# Begniner Coding Problems
I tried to cover as much as I could, but I skipped Binary Tree in intermediate because I thought the other algorithms were more important. These are interview problems, so they should be quite challenging. [Solutions](/solutions)

## Beginner
 1. Index of Character in String Without indexOf (Linear Search)
 2. Sum of 2D Array (Basic Traversal of 2D Array)
 3. N Factorial (Basic Index Manipulation)
 4. FizzBuzz [[412]](https://leetcode.com/problems/fizz-buzz/) (Stacked If-Statements)
 5. Index of Substring in String Without indexOf [[28]](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-strstr/) (Linear Search, Index Manipulation)
 6. Two Numbers in Array That Add to Target [[1]](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (Special Traversal of 2D Array)
 7. Nth Term of Fibonacci Sequence [[509]](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/) (Recursion/Repitition)
